This is an entirely pointless web app that I made for fun. It shows the weather conditions at your current location along with a randomly generated GIF, that might have something to do with the weather conditions and a maybe also cats, but also may be something else.

I use the Open Weather API and the Giphy API.

The background color changes according to the temperature and the time of day. Because why not.

Here are some things I practised while making this app:
- flex box
- module patterns
- http requests
